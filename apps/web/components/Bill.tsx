    Two different statements, and they had one shape between them.

    The first three qualify the figures above: the price table is old, a model
    could not be priced, lines would not parse. The fourth is not a warning at
    all — it lists findings this log cannot buy, which is the difference
    between "the numbers may be wrong" and "these questions are unanswerable
    from what you recorded". Loose terracotta prose said both in the same
    voice, with no container, so the whole block read as an error the reader
    had caused.
