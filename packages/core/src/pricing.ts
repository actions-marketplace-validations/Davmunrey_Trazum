 * a single date forces a partial review to either overstate itself by moving
 * the date for everyone, or throw itself away by leaving it. What happened is
 * the second: this constant was written on 2026-08-04 already reading
 * 2026-06-24, and never moved again.
 *
 * Meanwhile Anthropic cancelled the increase that was going to take Sonnet 5
 * from its 2/10 introductory price to 3/15 on 2026-09-01, and made 2/10
 * standard. The catalogue still carried the promotion with its end date, so on
 * 2026-09-01 every Sonnet 5 figure this tool printed would have risen 50% with
 * no code change and no way for a reader to tell. A price nobody charges is
 * the one error this product cannot make, and it was four days out on a timer.
 *
 * So: a date per provider, checked against that provider's own page, and the
 * catalogue's headline date derived as the oldest of them rather than typed.

 * it, and the warning says, in these words, that the table behind **every

 *
 * On 2026-08-31 that sentence was false on a report of Claude and OpenAI

 * no such report and whose providers stopped listing them — while the prices
 * actually used had been read four days and zero days earlier. A warning that
 * fires on every run is one people stop reading, and a provenance that does
 * not hold is the one thing this tool exists not to print.

 * `trazum models` had already worked this out and prints the dates per
 * provider, with the reason in a comment. The fix reached one surface and not
 * the three that qualify a figure.
 *
 * ## What it returns, and the direction it errs in
 *
 * The oldest review date among the providers that actually priced these
 * models. Where that cannot be established it returns the catalogue's own
 * `lastReviewed`, which is the **conservative** direction: reporting a fresher
 * date for a report containing a price of unknown provenance would be claiming
 * provenance this table does not have.
 *
 * It cannot be established in three cases, all of which fall back:
 *
 * - **An overlay is in effect.** `--pricing` and `--pricing-live` replace
 *   prices with numbers whose provenance is the overlay's own date, and
 *   `PROVIDER_REVIEWED` describes the bundled table rather than theirs.
 * - **A model the catalogue does not carry**, or one carrying no provider: a
 *   price with no page behind it.
 * - **A provider with no recorded review date.**
 *
 * The fallback is inside this function rather than at each call site on
 * purpose. `isOffered` records why: the fifth call site is always the one
 * written with only the first half of a two-part rule.
