/**
 * What the provider billed, beside what Trazum computed.
 *
 * The one figure nobody else gives you. Every other door here answers *what
 * did this usage cost at these rates*; the provider answers *what did we
 * charge you*, and the two are different questions that produce different
 * numbers. The gap between them is the interesting part, and until this file
 * there was nowhere to look at it.
 *
 * ## Why the two are never added
 *
 * `docs/commands.md` already states the rule for LiteLLM's `total_cost`: a
 * provider-billed figure is printed **beside** Trazum's and never merged into
 * it, because two price tables summed into one number is how a report becomes
 * quietly wrong. This file is that rule with arithmetic attached. Nothing here
 * corrects one figure with the other, and nothing here decides which is right:
 * they are two measurements of the same window, and the reader is the one
 * entitled to say which they trust.
 *
 * ## The unit, which is the trap
 *
 * `amount` is **a decimal string in the currency's lowest unit**: `"123.45"`
 * in USD is $1.2345, not $123.45. A reader of this API who takes the field for
 * dollars overstates a bill by a hundred times, and the figure looks entirely
 * plausible on a large organisation. It is divided by a hundred here, once, at
 * the end, and a test asserts the factor against the schema's own example.
 *
 * `currency` is documented as always `USD` today. It is still checked: a
 * converter that assumed it would be silently wrong the day it changes, and
 * summing two currencies into one total is the same failure as summing two
 * price tables. Anything but USD is refused rather than converted, because a
 * conversion needs a rate and inventing one is the sin this product is built
 * against.
 *
 * ## What the decomposition is for
 *
 * A difference nobody can attribute is a number that starts an argument. This
 * report can attribute most of one, when it is fetched with
 * `group_by[]=description`:
 *
 * - **`cost_type` other than `tokens`** — web search, code execution, session
 *   usage. Trazum prices tokens and nothing else, so every cent of these is
 *   billed money it never claimed to cover. Named rather than blamed.
 * - **`service_tier: "batch"`** — billed at a discount `from-anthropic`
 *   deliberately leaves out rather than misprice at a catalogue rate.
 *
 * What is left after both is the **remainder**, and it is the only figure here
 * worth arguing about: the same standard-tier tokens, priced two ways, or
 * usage the log never saw. A tool that folded the remainder into one of the
 * explanations would be hiding the only thing it was built to show.
 *
 * Without `group_by[]=description` none of that decomposition exists —
 * `cost_type`, `service_tier` and `model` are all `null` — and the reading
 * says so rather than reporting a remainder that is really the whole
 * difference wearing a smaller name.
