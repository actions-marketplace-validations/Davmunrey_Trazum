/**
 * A merge that changed this repository has a line in the changelog.
 *
 * ## The rule was written down and nothing held it
 *
 * `CHANGELOG.md` opens by saying it: *`Unreleased` holds what is merged into
 * `main` but not yet tagged. A change that alters nothing installable — a test,
 * a document — still lands there rather than nowhere: the changelog is the
 * record of what happened to this repository, and a merged commit with no entry
 * is a change only `git log` remembers.*
 *
 * Four consecutive pull requests after 2.3.0 left `Unreleased` empty. A CLI
 * flag, a wiki generator, a commit hook, a corrected skill and an advanced
 * Action pin — none of them wrote a line, and nothing anywhere failed. The
 * rule read as enforced because it was stated in the imperative, which is the
 * same shape as every unenforced rule this repository has found in itself.
 *
 * ## What this asks, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * It asks one question: **are there commits after the newest tag, and is this
 * section empty?** That is the state that cannot be right. It does not try to
 * match commits to entries — a mapping from pull requests to bullet points
 * would need either a convention in commit messages or a list somebody keeps in
 * step, and the second is the defect this file exists to catch.
 *
 * So a single line under `## Unreleased` satisfies it, and that is on purpose:
 * this guard catches the section nobody touched, which is the failure that
 * actually happened. Whether the line is *good* is what review is for.
 *
 * ## Why the tag, and what happens without one
 *
 * The newest tag is what "not yet released" is measured against, and asking git
 * is the only way to know it — the version in `package.json` is bumped in the
 * release pull request itself, so it agrees with the tag only after the tag
 * exists. `security.test.js` reaches for tags the same way and for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * A checkout with no tags cannot answer, and this **refuses rather than
 * passes**: a guard that goes quiet exactly where its input is missing is a
 * guard that reports green on every shallow clone. CI checks this repository
 * out at `fetch-depth: 0`, so the tags are there; a contributor running the
 * suite on a shallow clone is told what to fetch rather than told nothing.
