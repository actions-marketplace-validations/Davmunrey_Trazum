 * question about this tool, so a gap in it is not a documentation gap — it is a
 * wrong answer given to somebody who asked. Its config section listed **nine**
 * keys. The schema knows **seventeen**.
 *
 * The eight missing were `labels`, `spend`, `sources`, `store`, `waive`,
 * `outcomes`, `ladders` and `owners` — which is to say the entire budget
 * surface, the fleet, the waiver record, and the vocabulary the whole 1.51 arc
 * rests on. An agent asked *"can Trazum tell me whether the cheaper model made
 * things worse?"* would have read this list, not found `outcomes`, and said no.
 *
 * The section's command coverage is deliberately narrower than the CLI's — the
 * skill is scoped to optimising and budgeting a prompt — so an absent *command*
 * is not drift and is not asserted here. A key list that claims to be the key
 * list is a different thing.
