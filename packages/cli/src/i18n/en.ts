${bold('OPTIONS FOR init')}
  --dry-run                   Print the config it would write and write nothing.
  --yes                       Replace a trazum.config.json that is already there.
                              Without it an existing config is left alone.
  --json                      The proposal as data, including every key it
                              declined and why. Writes nothing.

  The first five minutes: finds your prompts, reads your code for which provider
  it calls, finds a usage log or a credential for one, and writes a config out of
  what it can actually justify. Then it prints the single most valuable thing it
  found, arithmetic first.

  It never invents a threshold. A budget is a policy, so init hands you the
  measured figure and leaves the limit to you: a generated config full of
  guessed numbers is one nobody trusts.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR conform')}
  --contract <name>           Check against a named contract instead of
                              detecting one: ${d.contracts.join(', ')}.
  --json                      The report as data.

  Answers two questions and keeps them apart. Does this document conform,
  required fields, present and the right type, exits 1 when not. And what can a
  valid document of this shape not answer, with the field that would unlock
  each.

  The second never gates. Choosing not to log sessions is a decision, not a
  defect. See docs/format.md.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR rollup')}
  --json                      The roll-up document as data. See docs/format.md.
  --html-out <file>           Also write the roll-up as one self-contained HTML
                              file, the team-facing report, for whoever pays
                              the bill. Each contributor's gaps stay under that
                              contributor, and what no merge can measure is in
                              the caveat block, impossible to crop.

  Several people's bills, one roll-up. Each contributor runs
  \`trazum profile --json\` where their traffic already is; this merges the
  documents. A format and a merge, not a service: nothing is uploaded and there
  is no account: the documents arrive however your team already moves files.

  Most of the output is what the merge could not do. Each contributor's own
  gaps stay with that contributor rather than being averaged into one figure,
  the findings that need individual calls are named instead of dropped, and
  every roll-up of more than one document says that overlap between
  contributors is unmeasurable: two people exporting the same traffic double
  the bill and no merge of summaries can see it.

  Exits 1 when a contribution was handed over and could not be merged.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR write')}
  --answers <file>            A JSON object of slot ids and answers. Without it,
                              the questions are asked one at a time; an empty
                              line declines one, which is an answer.
  --json                      The prompt-draft document, refusals included.
  -o, --out <file>            Where to write the prompt. Defaults to stdout,
                              with everything else on stderr.
  --calls <n>                 Calls per month, for the estimate.
  --avg-output <n>            Average output tokens per call, for the estimate.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR switch')}
  --to <model>                The candidate model, by catalogue id.
  --migration-usd <n>         What the migration itself would cost, declared
                              by you. Unlocks the break-even line.
  --cases <n>                 How many evaluation cases you would run.
                              Unlocks the line pricing that evaluation.

  The decision every what-if serves, priced: what this measured mix costs on
  the candidate, the saving with its sign stated, and, with a declared
  migration cost, the break-even as division on the measured past, days of
  window attached, never a forecast. The evaluation the switch requires is
  priced at this log's own mean call, two calls on the incumbent and one on
  the candidate per case. What it refuses: any sentence about quality, that
  verdict belongs to trazum route, and the report ends by printing it.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR ownrate')}
  --gpu-usd-hour <n>          What an hour of your hardware costs you.
  --tokens-per-second <n>     Throughput you measured on your own serving.
  --utilization <0-1>         Fraction of the hour actually serving.
                              Defaults to 1.

  Your self-hosted model's $/MTok, derived from your own two numbers,
  division, nothing else: no amortisation, no energy model, no guessed
  efficiency. Prints the figure and the pricing-overlay snippet to paste
  into trazum.config.json, so the model you run yourself becomes a
  first-class row in every report, priced by you and marked as such.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR reconcile')}
  --against <file>            The provider's cost report: Anthropic's
                              GET /v1/organizations/cost_report or OpenAI's
                              GET /v1/organization/costs, told apart by shape.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the comparison there instead of stdout.

  What Trazum computed beside what the provider billed, and never merged into
  it: two price tables summed into one number is how a report becomes quietly
  wrong. Fetch Anthropic's report with group_by[]=description, OpenAI's with
  group_by[]=line_item, and the difference is attributed - what no token rate
  covers, and for Anthropic what was batch-tier - leaving a remainder that is
  the only figure worth arguing about. OpenAI's report never names batch, so
  there it stays inside the remainder and the run says so. The windows must
  line up or nothing is compared, and a currency with no rate is refused
  rather than converted.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-anthropic')}
  --label <name>              The project this usage belongs to. The provider
                              does not know your project names.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  Anthropic's own usage report, read as a usage log. You fetch it yourself with
  your own admin credential; this reads the answer, so Trazum never holds a
  provider key. Ask for group_by[]=model, because a row without one cannot be
  priced, and group_by[]=service_tier, because batch is billed at a discount
  and pricing it from a catalogue rate would overstate the bill. Rows at any
  other tier are left out and counted, web search requests are counted and
  never priced from a token rate, and has_more says the bill is one page short.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-openai')}
  --label <name>              The project this usage belongs to. The provider
                              does not know your project names.
  --label-by-project <file>   One label per project id, as a JSON array of
                              {"project": "proj_…", "label": "name"}. Exact
                              match; --label is the fallback.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  OpenAI's own usage report, read as a usage log, under the same arrangement
  as from-anthropic: your curl, your admin key, and this reads the answer.
  Ask for group_by[]=model, because a row without one cannot be priced, and
  group_by[]=batch, because a batch job is billed at a discount and pricing it
  from a catalogue rate would overstate the bill. Any service tier but default
  is left out and named. Audio and image tokens are never priced at a text
  rate: a row carrying them is reduced to its text part and the rest is
  counted where you can see it.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR bill')}
  --label <name>              The project this usage belongs to, for the
                              shapes that take one.
  --stamp                     Stamp the receipt with the time it was written.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the receipt there instead of stdout.

  One door. Reads a file or a directory, tells each file's shape from its own
  text - a Claude Code transcript, OTel spans, a LiteLLM, Helicone or LangSmith
  export, an Anthropic, OpenAI or OpenRouter report, or a plain usage log -
  converts it with the same converter the dedicated command uses, prices it,
  and ends on the receipt. A file no shape claims is named, not guessed; a
  file two shapes claim is named as ambiguous and left alone; a provider's
  cost report is pointed at reconcile. Each file's line says how many rows
  were left out, and the dedicated from-<shape> command says why.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-openrouter')}
  --label <name>              The project this usage belongs to.
  --label-by-workspace <file> One label per workspace id, as a JSON array of
                              {"workspace": "…", "label": "name"}. Exact
                              match; --label is the fallback. Needs the report
                              fetched with group_by=workspace.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  OpenRouter's activity report (GET /api/v1/activity, management key, the last
  thirty days), read as a usage log keyed by the same model slugs the
  OpenRouter pricing overlay uses, so hundreds of models are priceable at
  once. What OpenRouter charged is printed beside Trazum's figure and never
  merged into it. Reasoning tokens are counted and not added, because the
  schema does not say whether the completion count already holds them.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-helicone')}
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  A Helicone request export, read as a usage log: model, timestamp, label and
  the token counts from each row, and nothing else. The request body, the
  response body and the user id stay in the row. The model that answered is
  what is priced, and rows answered by a different model than the one
  requested are counted. cache_enabled is a flag and never a token split, so
  cache verdicts read "cannot tell". A request id is one call and never a
  conversation, so the records carry no session and the conversation findings
  cannot be answered from this log; that is said on every run.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-langsmith')}
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  A LangSmith run export, read as a usage log: model, timestamp, label, the
  trace as the session, and the token counts, and nothing else. The inputs and
  the outputs stay in the run, and the metadata bag is read for named keys and
  never copied. Only run_type "llm" is a call: chains, tools and retrievers are
  skipped and counted, because the chain wrapping a call repeats its child's
  tokens. A run whose metadata names no model is refused rather than priced by
  the run's name, which is a client class. LangSmith's own cost is reported on
  its own and never merged into Trazum's.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-litellm')}
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  A LiteLLM spend log, read as a usage log: model, timestamp, label, session
  and the token counts from each row, and nothing else. The messages, the
  response, the hashed key, the requester address and the end user stay in the
  row. cache_hit is a flag and never a token split, so cache verdicts read
  "cannot tell" rather than a guessed one. Rows naming no model are counted
  and left out: model_group is a route, not a model. LiteLLM's own spend
  figure is printed beside Trazum's and never merged into it.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-otel')}
  --label-from-service        Label each record with its span's service name,
                              so a per-service bill falls out.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  OpenTelemetry GenAI spans, read as a usage log: model, timestamp, label and
  the token counts from each gen_ai.* span, and nothing else. Prompt content
  and trace ids stay in the span. OTel has no cache TTL split, so cache
  verdicts read "cannot tell" rather than a guessed one. Non-LLM spans are
  counted and skipped, said on stderr.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR from-claude-code')}
  --label <name>              Stamp every record with one label.
  --label-from-project        Label each record with its transcript's project
                              directory name, verbatim, map it to a workload
                              name with the config's \`labels\` block.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the usage log there instead of stdout.

  Claude Code's transcripts, read as a usage log: model, timestamp, session
  and the API's own usage object, the cache TTL split included, and
  nothing else. No message text, no paths, no branches cross the
  conversion. One API call is written as one line per content block, so
  lines are collapsed by request id; what was collapsed or passed over is
  said on stderr, never silently.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR position')}
  --html-out <file>           The position as one self-contained page, the
                              same sentences the terminal prints, caveats
                              first, for the person who does not run CLIs.
  --json                      The position document, contract-checked like
                              everything (\`--contract position\`).

  Where the month stands against every configured ceiling, measured from the
  named log alone with the denominator on every figure. The distance line is
  division on the past, labelled as such, and absent under the seven-day
  floor, on an over, and on a zero rate: never a forecast, and no field in
  the document names a date.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR receipt')}
  --stamp                     Record the emission time in the document. Off by
                              default so two runs on one log produce the same
                              bytes: the period the figures cover is already in
                              there, from the log's own clock.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the receipt there instead of to standard
                              output. The summary always goes to standard
                              error, so a redirect writes a document and not a
                              document with a summary stapled to the front.
  --pricing <file>            Price it with your own card instead of the
                              bundled catalogue.
  --pricing-live              Price it against live rates via OpenRouter.

  A profile answers where it ran. A receipt is the same figures shaped so they
  still answer somewhere else: every line carries the rates behind its money
  and the date that provider's rates were last read off its own page. What is
  not in it is prompt text, answers, file paths, branch names, credentials and
  sessions: not redacted, absent, because the shape it is built from has no
  field that can hold them. It sends nothing anywhere.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR pulse')}
  --max-stale-hours <n>       Exit 1 when something that runs here has not run
                              in over n hours. Without it, the ages are
                              reported and nothing is judged.
  --json                      The report as data.

  Did the things that are supposed to run, run? \`watch --once\` is built for a
  scheduler, and its state file is read by exactly one thing, the next cycle.
  So nothing could tell you the watcher had stopped, because the thing that
  would tell you was the thing that stopped.

  It runs nothing and hosts nothing. Something has to notice, and the something
  is your CI: a step running this on the schedule you already have turns a dead
  cron into a red build, without Trazum holding anybody's metrics.

  Never gates on a first run that never happened: that has no cadence to be
  late against, and never on how far the measurements reach, which is a
  provider reporting on its own schedule rather than a job that failed.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR bench')}
  --workload <id>             Run one standard workload instead of all of them.
                              An unknown id is refused with the known ones named.
  --record <file>             Also write the measured ratios as a baseline, to
                              commit. The file --against reads.
  --against <file>            Judge this run's ratios against a recorded
                              baseline. Exits 1 when any measured workload is
                              past its recorded ratio times --max-ratio.
  --max-ratio <n>             The stated factor, at least 1. Required with
                              --against: how much regression is too much is a
                              policy, and this tool does not write yours.
  --json                      The measurements as data. The shape never changes
                              with the gate flags: a verdict is the exit code
                              and sentences on stderr, the way check gates.

  Measures this machine: the standard workloads, one shot each, wall time and
  peak RSS. The wall clock is for a person with a change in hand; the gate
  holds the ratio of workload to an in-process calibration loop, because a CI
  runner lies about wall time to both by the same amount and the lie cancels
  out. Each workload runs in its own child process, so a peak is that
  workload's own; the inputs are generated, deterministic and never written to
  your project.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR rules')}
  --measure <dir>             Measure what each rule actually recovers over the
                              prompts in that directory, instead of listing what
                              each one does.
  --level <safe|aggressive>   Which rules to measure. Default: safe.
  --json                      The measurement as data.

  Without --measure it lists the rules and what each is for. With it, the
  optimiser is run once per rule alone and once per rule removed, and both
  figures are printed: where two rules find the same tokens they diverge, and
  either one on its own would be wrong in a different direction.

  The floor is separated out. The optimiser normalises whitespace whether or not
  a rule is enabled, and crediting that to the rules is how a headline
  percentage survives on a corpus where the rules recover nothing.

  "Inert" is always said about the corpus. A rule that finds nothing in these
  files has not been shown to find nothing anywhere.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR feedback')}
  (none)

  Prints where to report a wrong optimisation, a bug, a question or a security
  problem, and a blank issue with the version, runtime and platform already
  filled in, printed in full first so nothing travels you have not read.

  It sends nothing. Trazum has no telemetry: no ping, no install hook, no
  anonymous counter, and a test fails the build if this command ever reaches
  the network.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR gateway')}
  --on-cannot-tell <policy>   Required, no default: fail-open or fail-closed.
                              What happens when the gateway cannot judge a call:
                              no budget, nothing measured, an unpriced model.
  --port <n> | --socket <p>   Where to listen. Loopback only, always.
  --log <usage.jsonl>         The usage log the limits policy is measured
                              against, read once at start, same flag as
                              serve's, same reason: label and session spend
                              live in a usage log, not in the store.

  Stands between your SDK and the provider, speaking their wire format, so no
  code changes. Usage is measured from the provider's own response as it comes
  back, no export, no connector lag, no missing day.

  It refuses and never substitutes: a call over budget gets HTTP 402 with the
  cheaper alternatives named. Substitution happens only where you wrote it down
  in spend.substitute, with your reason, and every substituted call is marked.

  Your credential is forwarded untouched and never read. See docs/gateway.md.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR experiment')}
  --a <label>, --b <label>    The two workloads to compare.
  --min-outcomes <n>          Required: how many outcomes each arm must record
                              before the result may be read. A stopping rule
                              declared after looking at the numbers is not a
                              stopping rule, and the report says whether it was
                              honoured.

  Judges recorded outcomes and cost together. Three-valued: A wins, B wins, or
  not separable, with the number of outcomes per arm that would settle it, so
  "run it longer" is an instruction rather than a shrug. Nothing is promoted.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR quality')}
  --label <name>              The workload to judge. Required: a mixture would
                              average a regression away.
  --at <iso>                  When the change landed. Required: without a
                              boundary there is nothing to compare across, and
                              picking one would be this tool choosing which
                              change to blame.
  --gate                      Exit 1 on a measured drop, 2 on "cannot tell".
                              Three outcomes, never two.

  A before-and-after rather than an experiment, so it reports "cannot tell"
  whenever the model mix, the call volume or the outcome coverage moved across
  the boundary: the prompt is not the only variable and it says so.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR semantic')}
  --yes                       Required to send anything. Without it the command
                              prints what the call would cost and stops.
  --model <id>                Which model to ask. Priced from the catalogue.

  Finds what a dictionary cannot: the same rule taught twice in different
  words, an instruction restated far away, a policy a later clause contradicts.
  Every quoted passage is checked character for character against the prompt,
  pairs the rules engine already catches are dropped, and every token figure is
  counted rather than believed. Optional, and always will be.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR commitment')}
  --floor <usd>               What you commit to spending each month, after
                              the discount. Required.
  --discount <pct>            What you get off list. 20 and 0.2 both work.
  --months <n>                How long the deal runs. Defaults to 12.

  Replays measured whole months against the deal's terms. Both directions are
  priced: the months that cleared the floor, and what the floor cost in the
  months that fell short, kept as its own figure, because netted into the
  saving it disappears. An as-if calculation about the past, never a forecast.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR report')}
  --year <yyyy>               Required. Which year to assemble.
  --json                      The record as data.

  Everything comes from the store and the plans you already keep: nothing is
  computed that cannot be checked against a document that already exists.
  Months with no record are named rather than filled, promises are kept in
  three outcomes rather than two, and the report lists what it cannot say.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR prune')}
  --cases <file>              One input per line, or a JSON array. Required.
  --yes                       Actually spend the calls. Without it the estimate is
                              printed and nothing is called.
  --concurrency <n>           Calls in flight at once. Default: 3.
  --json                      The measurement as data.

  Removes each few-shot example in turn and measures whether the answers move
  further than the prompt already moves on its own. The bill is
  (2 + examples) x cases, which is why this is the one command that asks first.

  It reports "no effect on these inputs" and never "delete this": an example may
  exist for a case your inputs do not contain. Nothing is edited.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR eval')}
  --cases <file>              One input per line, or a JSON array. Required.
  --level <safe|aggressive>   Which rewrite to judge. Default: safe.
  --concurrency <n>           Calls in flight at once. Default: 3.
  --export promptfoo          Write a promptfoo suite instead of running anything:
                              both prompts, every case, no API key needed and no
                              call made. The assertions are yours: this exists
                              for the question agreement cannot answer.
  -o, --out <file>            Where to write it. Defaults to stdout.

  Runs both prompt versions over your cases and reports whether the
  optimisation changed the answers. Costs THREE provider calls per case: the
  original twice, to measure the model's own run-to-run variance, and the
  optimised once. That baseline is the yardstick, without it, a divergence
  figure means nothing. Exits with code 1 when the answers genuinely diverge.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR rank')}
  --level <safe|aggressive>   Which rules to count as recoverable. Default: safe.
  --model, --calls,           Price the recoverable tokens, as in optimize.
  --output-tokens, --batch
  --prompt <name>             Which marked prompt to take from each source file.
  --by-source                 The fleet: one summary per service from the
                              config's "sources" block (name → glob patterns
                              over log paths), plus a rollup naming the source
                              where the money is. Shares compare totals, and
                              when the sources' logs cover different periods
                              the report says so rather than letting a 3-day
                              log look cheap beside a 30-day one. Budgets per
                              service live in spend.bySource and fail the run
                              naming the service. Files matching no pattern
                              are named, never silently dropped.
  --markdown-out <file>       Also write the ranking as Markdown, for a CI job
                              summary or a pull request comment.
  --json                      The ranking as data.

  There is no score. Prompts are ordered by what the rules would actually
  recover, measured by running them; the other columns explain that position.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR doctor')}
  --level <safe|aggressive>   Which rules to count. Default: safe.
  --model, --calls,           Price the findings, as in optimize.
  --output-tokens, --batch
  --prompt <name>             Which marked prompt to take from each source file.
  --otlp-out <file>           Write the survey as OpenTelemetry metrics (OTLP/HTTP
                              JSON). Trazum writes the file; your pipeline sends it.
  --json                      The survey as data.

  Surveys a whole workspace: which prompts nothing is watching, which are already
  over budget, and what the advisories add up to across all of them. Every finding
  is one trazum optimize raises on that prompt on its own, so any line can be
  checked against a single file. There is no score.

  It exits 0 even when it finds things. trazum check is the gate.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR blame')}
  --limit <n>                 Revisions to walk. Default: 20, maximum 500.
  --prompt <name>             Track one marked prompt inside a source file, so a
                              refactor of the imports is not read as growth.
  --model, --calls,           Price the movement, exactly as in optimize.
  --output-tokens, --batch
  --markdown-out <file>       Also write the history as Markdown, for a CI job
                              summary or a pull request comment.
  --json                      The history as data.

  Paths are taken literally after "--": trazum blame -- --odd-name.txt

${bold('OPTIONS FOR optimize')}
  --level <safe|aggressive>   How hard the rules push. Default: safe.
  --model <id>                Model used to price the prompt. Default: ${d.model}.
  --calls <n>                 Calls per month. Default: ${d.callsPerMonth}.
  --output-tokens <n>         Average output tokens. Default: ${d.avgOutputTokens}.
  --cache-hit-rate <0-1>      Estimated cache hit rate. Default: ${d.cacheHitRate}.
  --all-labels                With --from-log: every prompt in the config's
                              "labels" map, optimised and priced against its
                              own measured traffic, ranked by what the change
                              is worth, plus the mismatches in both
                              directions (mapped prompts with no traffic,
                              traffic with no mapped prompt).
  --from-log <usage.jsonl>    Measure the three figures above from a usage log
                              instead of typing them: real call count, real
                              output size, real cache share, and the model the
                              calls actually went to. Refuses the typed flags
                              beside it, scales to a month only past a full
                              week of data, and says which figures are
                              measured. Pair with --label, or map the prompt
                              under "labels" in trazum.config.json.
  --batch                     The work tolerates latency (Batch API, 50% off).
  --disable <id,id>           Turn off specific rules (see "trazum rules").
  --suggest                   Ask the LLM for phrase-level rewrites and list them
                              with what each saves. Changes nothing on its own,
                              every proposal is checked against your prompt first
                              and dropped if it does not survive.
  --apply-suggestions         Take them. Only with --suggest; alone it is an error
                              rather than a flag that runs and does nothing.
  --cache-suggestions         Answer --suggest from a local cache when the same
                              prompt was asked about before, instead of paying for
                              the call again. Off by default: a hit is what the
                              model said last time, and that should be a choice.
                              Kept in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/trazum, 0600, for 7 days.
  --reorder                   Move stable instructions ahead of the first placeholder,
                              so prompt caching can reach them. This MOVES text rather
                              than deleting it: read the diff and decide whether the
                              order mattered. Refuses on any block that refers
                              backwards ("the text above"), and says which phrase.
  --llm                       Add a pass through the LLM configured by environment.
  --exact-tokens              Count tokens with Anthropic's endpoint, not the heuristic.
                              Claude models only: it is Claude's tokenizer.
  --tokens-only               Report the token saving and no money at all. The
                              default inside Claude Code, Codex or Cursor, where
                              a subscription means there is no bill to reduce.
  --cost                      Show the money even there: the host says where
                              Trazum runs, not where your prompt goes.
  --prompt <name>             Which marked prompt to optimise, when a source file
                              holds more than one. See "trazum where".
  --diff                      Show the line-by-line diff.
  --json                      Dump the full report as JSON.
  --locale <${d.locales.join('|')}>            Language of the report. Default: the system language.
  --max-input <chars>         Raise (or lower) the prompt-input ceiling, per run.
                              Above it a prompt door refuses with the size and
                              the limit named rather than grinding. Logs and
                              documents are never held to it.
  -o, --out <file>            Write the optimised prompt to a file.
  -h, --help                  This help.
  --clear-suggestion-cache    Empty the --cache-suggestions cache and say how much
                              went. An errand rather than a mode: it needs no
                              command and reads no config.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR check')}
  --max-tokens <n>            Input token budget. Required unless a config budget covers the file.
  --level <safe|aggressive>   Level used to work out whether the optimised prompt would fit.
  --exact-tokens              Exact count (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).
  --json                      Result as JSON.
  --markdown-out <file>       Also write the report as Markdown, for a CI job summary
                              or a pull request comment.
  --baseline                  Gate on the recorded cost baseline. On by default whenever
                              the config declares one, so CI needs no argument; the useful
                              spelling is --no-baseline, which skips it for one run.
  --files-from <file|->       Check only the files listed, one path per line, the shape
                              git diff --name-only produces, so a pre-commit hook is one
                              pipe: git diff --cached --name-only | trazum check --files-from -
                              Non-prompt paths and deletions are dropped and counted out
                              loud; a list with nothing checkable passes. Budgets apply
                              per file as always; the baseline needs the whole repository
                              and is skipped, and says so.

  Built for CI: exits with code 1 when the prompt busts the budget, so a
  template that grows unchecked breaks the build instead of the bill.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR baseline')}
  Records what the prompts in a directory cost right now, to a file you commit.
  Then "check" fails the build when the repository drifts past it: the question
  budgets cannot answer, because a repository at 95% of every budget passes
  forever while a pull request adds four hundred tokens across a dozen files.

  -o, --out <file>            Where to write it. Default: the config's baseline.path,
                              or trazum.baseline.json.
  --model, --calls, --output-tokens, --cache-hit-rate, --batch
                              The scenario the monthly figure is recorded under. It is
                              recorded so a later comparison can say whether the money is
                              comparable: the gate itself is in tokens, so a repriced
                              model never fails a build on its own.
  --exact-tokens              Exact counts (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).
  --json                      Result as JSON.

  It never fails. Recording is not a verdict, and a command that could fail while
  writing the thing you would fix the failure with is a loop.

  Given a directory it checks every prompt inside it against the "budgets"
  patterns in ${bold('trazum.config.json')}: one CI step for a whole repository of
  prompts. A file no pattern covers is listed as unbudgeted rather than
  skipped quietly, and a run where nothing at all was budgeted is an error:
  "0 failures" from a check that measured nothing is the most misleading
  thing this tool could tell you.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR ladder')}
  --since <when>              Read only calls in this window. A UTC day
  --until <when>              (2026-08-14), a full ISO 8601 timestamp, a
                              relative window (7d, 24h) or "now". Calls with no
                              "ts" cannot be placed and are left out, counted
                              out loud, never dropped silently.
  --label <name>              Judge one workload's ladder rather than the whole
                              log. A label that matches nothing is an error
                              naming the labels that exist.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR owners')}
  --since <when>              Read only calls in this window, in the same forms
  --until <when>              the other commands take. What no owner claims is
                              reported as unallocated and never spread across
                              the ones that are known.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR profile')}
  --against <log.jsonl>       Compare this bill to a previous log. Positive
                              means the bill grew; drivers are ranked by their
                              contribution to the change. No period is assumed,
                              judge the call counts before judging the money.
  --label <name>              Profile only the calls carrying this label, the
                              drill-down once the full report named a suspect.
                              A label that matches nothing is an error naming
                              the labels that exist. With --against, both logs
                              are filtered, so the comparison stays one workload.
  --max-usd <n>               Exit 1 when this log spent more than n dollars.
                              The budget applies to exactly the log handed in:
                              profile yesterday's log nightly and this is a
                              daily budget without Trazum guessing what a day is.
  --max-growth-usd <n>        With --against: exit 1 when the bill grew more
                              than n dollars over the previous log. Alone it is
                              an error, not a flag that silently gates nothing.
  --max-cache-loss-usd <n>    Exit 1 when caching added more than n dollars to
                              this bill. Reads the worst case when the log did
                              not record the write TTL: a gate reading the
                              flattering half would pass the bills it exists
                              to catch, and says which claim fired.

  --max-session-usd <n>       Fail when any single conversation in the log

                              --until with a bare date includes that whole day.
                              Calls with no "ts" cannot be placed and are left
                              out, counted out loud, never dropped silently.

                              file, the one to email to whoever pays the bill.
                              Same figures as --json, caveats rendered as
                              prominently as the totals they qualify.
  --csv-shape <shape>         Which table --csv-out writes: slice (default),
                              day, hour, or model-day (one row per day and
                              model, charts the mix moving). One row shape
                              per file, so nothing has to be filtered before
                              it can be summed.
  --csv-out <file>            Also write the report as CSV, one row per label
                              and model. No total row, on purpose: a total
                              inside a data file gets summed with the data.
                              Unpriced models keep their tokens and get empty
                              dollar cells, never zeros.
  --pricing <file>            Local price overlay, as everywhere else.
  --json                      The full report as data, including the levers.

  Takes a log file or a directory of them, rotated daily logs are read in
  name order as one bill, and how many were read is stated. Gzipped files
  (.jsonl.gz and the rest) are read too, because that is what a rotated log
  looks like a day later; one that will not decompress is an error naming the
  file, never a bill quietly missing a day.

  Reads what the provider actually charged. Optional fields unlock findings:
  "label" (which workload), "session" (which conversation, grouped by, never
  printed), "stop_reason"/"finish_reason" (answers cut off at max_tokens).

${bold('OPTIONS FOR plan')}
  --min-usd <n>               Leave out actions worth less than n dollars. How

  --pricing <file>            Local price overlay, as everywhere else.
  --json                      The plan as data.

  Reads a usage log and turns the report's findings into a ranked plan: route
  this, batch that, fix the truncation pair, look at the cache. The money is
  composed correctly, route and batch on the same slice arrive combined,
  never summed, and every action names what the log cannot confirm, because
  a plan that hides its assumptions is advice pretending to be arithmetic.
  Projected savings and money already spent are separate totals throughout.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR serve')}
  --port <n>                  Port on 127.0.0.1. Default: 7317.
  --socket <path>             Listen on a Unix socket instead of a port.
  --log <usage.jsonl>         The usage log the limits policy is measured
                              against, read once at start. Per-label and
                              per-session spend live in a usage log, not in
                              the store; without this, every ceiling in
                              "limits" answers cannot-tell.

  Answers the two questions that matter at call time, what will this cost,
  and is there budget left, in single-digit milliseconds, so an agent or a
  wrapper can ask before it spends rather than reading a report afterwards.

  POST /cost with {"model": "...", "inputTokens": n, "outputTokens": n};
  GET /health says it is up. Every answer keeps the measured half and the
  estimated half apart: the budget consumed comes from the provider's billed
  counts, the cost of the call being asked about is an estimate of something
  that has not happened, and the verdict says which of the two it rests on.

  It listens on 127.0.0.1 and nowhere else, and there is no flag to change
  that: a cost oracle on a network interface holds a company's spend, its
  model mix and its budgets, and answers whoever asks. There is no auth for
  the same reason there is no --host: a token checked over loopback is
  theatre, and the honest posture is a surface small enough not to need one.

  With no store and no budget it still prices the call and says the budget
  half is unknown. Offline is a mode, not a failure.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR watch')}
  --once                      One cycle: measure, keep, evaluate, emit,
                              remember. What a cron entry runs. The default.
  --interval <n>m|h           Stay in the foreground and repeat. Minimum five
                              minutes: usage APIs are rate limited, and a tight
                              loop is a way to get your own key throttled.
  --webhook <url>             POST the crossings somewhere. https only, except
                              loopback; a URL carrying credentials is refused,
                              because URLs end up in logs and shell history.
  --payload <file>            Evaluate a usage payload you already have,
                              instead of the store.
  --json                      The cycle as data: crossings, abstentions, gap.

  Evaluates the spend gates from your config, maxUsd, maxDayUsd,
  maxCacheLossUsd, against what has been measured, and tells you the
  afternoon it happens rather than three weeks later. Exits 1 when something
  crossed, so cron mails it and CI fails.

  An alert fires on a measured crossing and never on a projection: "you have
  spent $412 of a $400 budget" is a fact and "you will exceed" is a forecast,
  which this tool does not make at any window length. A day still being
  measured is reported as not yet judgeable rather than passed, but a day
  already over budget fires whatever the hour, because it does not become less
  over budget at midnight.

  A restart does not re-alert on a crossing already reported, and names the
  stretch it was not watching, because a watcher that resumes in silence
  implies coverage it did not have.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR store')}
  --prune                     Drop measurements older than the retention
                              policy, and compact the append log to what the
                              store already resolves to. Says what went.
  --keep <n>d                 Retention for this run, when the config has none.
  --dry-run                   With --prune: say what would go, and delete
                              nothing.
  --json                      The inventory as data.

  Says what the local store holds: how many measurements, over what span, per
  provider, and what a prune would take. The store keeps aggregates and
  billing fields, never prompt text, never completion text, never a
  credential, so it is a file a team can back up without a privacy review.

  Pruning is the one operation here that destroys something, so it refuses to
  run without a retention policy: set "store": {"keepDays": 90} in the config
  or pass --keep. Deleting measurements on a policy nobody wrote down is not a
  default anybody should get by accident.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR connect')}
  --since <when>              The window to pull. A UTC day, an ISO timestamp,
  --until <when>              a relative window (7d, 24h) or "now". Defaults to
                              the last 30 days.
  --dry-run                   Say what would be called and which environment
                              variable the key would come from. Sends nothing
                              and needs no credential.
  --payload <file>            Price a usage payload you already have, instead of
                              pulling one. No credential, no network, the same
                              arithmetic on the same shape.
  --store                     Keep what was pulled in the local store, so the
                              next run does not download it again and "trazum
                              history --store" has a series.
  -o, --out <file>            Save the priced report as JSON.
  --markdown-out <file>       Also write it as Markdown, for a CI job summary.
  --json                      The report as data.

  Reads your bill from the provider's usage API, so nothing has to be exported
  by hand. The credential is read from the environment at the moment of the
  call and never stored, never printed and never written to a config: set
  TRAZUM_ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY or TRAZUM_OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY. Each provider needs
  the narrowest key that can read a usage report, and an ordinary API key
  cannot.

  These APIs serve sums over a window, not one row per call, so a connected
  report is a restricted one and says so: the totals, the model split, the day
  series and the cache verdict are all available, and the per-call findings,
  input shapes, truncation retries, conversations, context pressure, are
  listed as unavailable with what would unlock them. A rate limit, a page cap
  or an expired cursor returns what arrived with the gap named, never a total
  that quietly describes less traffic than you asked about.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR history')}
  --store                     Build the series from the local store instead of
                              a directory of stored reports. Bucketed sources
                              carry no label, so the label series is absent and
                              said to be: the model-share and cache-share
                              series are what a series exists for, and both
                              work.
  --markdown-out <file>       Also write the series as Markdown, for a CI job
                              summary or a pull request comment.
  --json                      The history as data.

  Takes a directory of stored reports, the --json documents profile already
  writes, plus any saved plans beside them, and builds the series no
  pairwise comparison can see: a workload climbing a little every period, a
  model share rising since a date, a cache share decaying slowly enough that
  no single week's report called it a finding, and the same action planned
  again and again with nothing executing it. Derived from stored reports,
  never re-parsed logs, so a year of JSON is enough and the raw logs can be
  thrown away. Shapes are named; nothing is forecast.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR verify')}
  --against <log|dir>         The newer usage log the plan is held to. Required.
  --gate                      Exit 1 when an action did not produce what the
                              plan promised, or its fields stopped being
                              recorded, "not recorded" must not read as
                              "fixed". A vanished workload fails nothing.
  --markdown-out <file>       Also write the verdicts as Markdown, for a CI
                              job summary or a pull request comment.
  --pricing <file>            Local price overlay, as everywhere else.
  --json                      The verification as data.

  Holds a saved plan to the log that came after it, with three outcomes and
  never two: the change arrived, it did not, or it cannot be told, because
  the workload vanished, the fields the detection needs stopped being
  recorded, or tokens cannot say which tier billed them. Differences carry
  the world's measured movement (calls, output per call) from the plan's own
  baseline, and a plan priced under a different catalogue says so rather
  than blaming a team for a saving that arithmetic revoked.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR route')}
  --prompt-file <file>        The prompt those calls send. Not --prompt, which
                              names a marked prompt inside a source file.
  --cases <file>              One input per line, or a JSON array. Required.
  --label <name>              Measure this workload instead of the costliest one.
  --concurrency <n>           Calls in flight at once. Default: 3.
  --yes                       Actually spend the calls. Without it the count is
                              printed and nothing is called.
  --json                      The slice and the measurement as data.

  Reads a usage log, finds the slice where routing to a cheaper model is worth
  the most, and measures whether that model still does the job. The same prompt
  goes to both, and the original runs twice per case, so the verdict is judged
  against that model's own variance rather than a threshold somebody picked.

  Costs three provider calls per case and needs TRAZUM_LLM_* configured.

${bold('OPTIONS FOR diff')}
  --max-growth <n>            Fail if the prompt grew by more than n tokens.
  --all                       Compare two directories of prompts, paired by relative
                              path. Prompts on only one side are named, never
                              counted: a deletion is a question, not a saving.
                              --max-growth then applies per prompt, not to the
                              total, so one prompt doubling cannot hide behind
                              another shrinking.
  --optimized                 Measure what the rules would leave, not what is written.
  --level <safe|aggressive>   Level used for the rule and advisory findings.
  --model <id>                Model used to price the change.
  --calls <n>                 Calls per month, for the cost figure.
  --json                      Result as JSON.
  --markdown-out <file>       Also write the report as Markdown, for a CI job summary
                              or a pull request comment.

  Compares two versions of a prompt: how the token count moved, what that
  costs, which advisories the edit introduced or resolved. Every figure is a
  delta and positive means worse. It reports and exits 0 unless --max-growth
  is given: deciding that growth is unacceptable is your call, not ours.

${bold('trazum where')}
  Says which provider a file's prompts are actually sent to, and how it knows,
  an SDK import, a base URL, a quoted model id, or "model=" on a trazum:prompt
  marker. Every answer names the line it came from.

  It refuses when a file names two providers rather than picking one. Two
  answers is not a weaker version of one answer, and picking silently is how
  somebody budgets against the wrong provider for a month.

  A base URL beats the SDK it was pointed at: Moonshot, DeepSeek, xAI and Groq
  are all called through the OpenAI SDK with a different base_url, so treating
  that as a contradiction would refuse to price an ordinary client.

  With no file, it reports only which tool Trazum is running inside, and warns
  when that tool bills by subscription, because a monthly saving is arithmetic
  about tokens there, not money you get back.

${bold('CONFIG FILE')}
  ${bold('trazum.config.json')}, found by walking up from the working directory and
  stopping at the repository root. Every key is optional:

    level, locale, disable, maxGrowth, extensions, ignore
    usage     { model, callsPerMonth, avgOutputTokens, cacheHitRate, batchEligible }
    budgets   { "prompts/**": 2000, "prompts/system.txt": 4000 }
    baseline  { "path": "trazum.baseline.json", "maxGrowthTokens": 0, "maxGrowthPct": 5 }
    pricing   "./prices.json": local price corrections, see below
    labels    { "support-rag": "prompts/support.txt" }: which prompt file each
              usage-log label sends, so "trazum profile" can read the file and
              say why a failing cache fails
    spend     { "maxUsd": 200, "byLabel": { "chat": 40 } }: money budgets for
              "trazum profile", in dollars. A budgeted label with no calls in
              the log is reported as not measured, never as a pass
    limits    { "dayUsd": 25, "sessionUsd": 1.5, "byLabel": { "chat": 5 } }:
              the enforcement policy: USD ceilings judged before a call is
              made, at whichever door it arrives (the gateway's 402, "serve",
              spend_guard over MCP). Separate from "spend" because a report
              gate and a call refusal are read at different moments; every
              ceiling must be a positive number, because a ceiling of 0 is an
              outage written as a policy
    owners    { "patterns": { "payments": ["billing-*"] },
              "shared": { "search": { "payments": 0.6, "support": 0.4 } },
              "budgets": { "payments": 400 } }: whose budget each workload
              lands on. Spend matching no owner is its own line and is NEVER
              divided between the others; a shared split must sum to 1, and the
              rule travels with the report so the argument is about the rule
    ladders   { "support": { "tiers": ["claude-haiku-4-5", "claude-opus-5"],
              "escalateOn": ["escalated"] } }: cheap model first, escalate a
              recorded failure to a dearer one. Both fields required.
              "trazum ladder <log>" prints the break-even escalation rate
              beside the measured one: an escalation pays twice, so above that
              rate the ladder costs more than never having built it
    outcomes  { "values": ["resolved", "escalated"], "success": ["resolved"] }:
              your own vocabulary for what happened, and which of it counts as
              a win. Both required: which words mean success is a judgement
              about your product rather than your bill, and this tool has no
              standing to make it. Use [] if none of them are successes. A
              value in a log that "values" never declares is named as
              undeclared, never counted as a failure
    waive     [{ "gate": "maxUsd", "reason": "August migration", "until":
              "2026-09-15" }]: a gate failure decided about, on the record.
              All three fields required: a waiver with no end date is a
              finding deleted with extra steps. Waived failures still print,
              and the day the waiver expires the gate fails again

  Flags beat the config; the config beats the defaults. Budgets resolve to the
  most specific matching pattern: most literal characters wins. A boolean the
  config switched on comes back off with --no-<flag>, e.g. --no-batch.

  ${bold('budgets')} is a ceiling; ${bold('baseline')} is a gate. One asks whether a file fits,
  the other whether the repository got worse than the commit somebody recorded
  with "trazum baseline". A repository at 95% of every budget passes forever
  while a pull request adds four hundred tokens across a dozen files. With
  baseline in the config, "check" on a directory reads it and gates on it, no
  flag, because a gate you have to remember to pass an argument to runs in the
  author's terminal and not in CI. Thresholds are in tokens, never dollars: a
  repriced model would otherwise fail a build for a change nobody made.

  A config that will not validate is an error, including an unknown key. A
  lenient parser would silently restore defaults, and for a budget the default
  is "no budget", a green build for a prompt nobody measured.

  --config <file>             Use this config instead of searching for one.

${bold('PRICES')}
  Prices change on someone else's schedule, so correcting one does not require
  upgrading Trazum. A pricing overlay is a JSON file layered over the bundled
  catalogue:

    { "lastReviewed": "2027-01-15",
      "models": { "claude-opus-5": { "inputPerMTok": 6 } } }

  Only the fields you name change. A model the bundled catalogue does not have
  must be complete, because a half-defined model would price at nothing and
  report a saving that is not there. "promo": null withdraws a promotion.

  Every report says when overlaid prices were used and which models they cover:
  a figure from the bundled catalogue and a figure from your JSON file otherwise
  look identical.

  --pricing <file>            Use this overlay, ahead of the config's own.
  --pricing-live              Take prices from OpenRouter instead of the bundled
                              table: today's figures for hundreds of models across
                              dozens of providers. Opt-in, because it is a network
                              call: the deterministic core never makes one.
                              A --pricing file wins over this.

                              What that source does not publish is whether a model
                              has prompt caching or the minimum prefix it caches
                              at. Models it adds therefore get no caching advice
                              at all, rather than a guess: claiming caching works
                              would offer a saving nobody can buy, and claiming it
                              does not would hide the largest saving there is.

${bold('OPTIONAL LLM')}
  The core is deterministic and free. --llm adds a semantic compression pass
  using whichever provider you configure by environment:

    TRAZUM_LLM_PROVIDER   openai | anthropic          (default: openai)
    TRAZUM_LLM_BASE_URL   https://your-llm/v1
    TRAZUM_LLM_API_KEY    your key
    TRAZUM_LLM_MODEL      model identifier

  The LLM's answer is only accepted when it is shorter and leaves code, URLs
  and template placeholders untouched.

${bold('LANGUAGE')}
  The report language follows --locale, then TRAZUM_LOCALE, then LANG, and last
  the config file, so a project can set the language its CI logs read in
  without overriding the language of whoever is at the keyboard. It changes the
  report only: the same prompt always optimises the same way.
