/**
 * The tools, kept in one file so the whole surface an agent can reach reads in one

 *
 * **Three deliberate absences, and they are the security design.**
 *
 * *No paths.* Every tool takes prompt text. A tool that accepted a filename would
 * be a file-read primitive reachable by whatever the model decided to ask for, and
 * "we reviewed it" is not a durable defence against one being added later. This
 * package imports `@trazum/core`, the browser-safe entry point, and never
 * `@trazum/core/node` — so the capability is *absent* rather than unused, and a
 * test enforces that.
 *
 * *No network.* Nothing here calls a model. `--suggest` and `eval` exist in the
 * CLI and are deliberately not exposed: they spend the caller's money, and a tool
 * an agent can invoke in a loop must not be able to do that. Everything below is
 * arithmetic on text.
 *
 * *No writes.* The tools return figures. Applying them is the agent's job, in its
 * own context, where a human can see the diff.
