# Trazum documentation

Somebody choosing this tool, somebody using it, somebody extending it and
somebody maintaining it want four different documents, and a file that serves
two of them serves neither. Find yourself below. The fifth section is for when
something is wrong.

---

## I am deciding whether to use this

Start at the [README](../README.md) — what it is, what it costs you to try, and
one worked example per command.

Then, if you want to know whether to trust the numbers:

- **[The doctrine](doctrine.md)** — the rules this product refuses to break, each
  one discovered by getting it wrong first. This is the actual argument for why a
  cost figure from this tool is worth reading.
- **[Our own medicine](our-own-medicine.md)** — the same standard applied to this
  project: what it refused to ship, what it got wrong and for how long, and what
  it cannot say about itself.
- **[Any input](hardening.md)** — what is promised about input this tool was
  never meant to see, and the seeded fuzz suite in CI that holds each promise:
  never throws, never grows, idempotent, masks intact, money never negative.
- **[What is open, what is not](licensing.md)**: the three questions LICENSE
  leaves unanswered: what the licence covers today, what will never move out of
  it, and what it never covered at all. Written while there is one copyright
  holder and nothing to gain from a convenient answer.

## I am using it

In the order somebody actually meets them:

| | |
|---|---|
| [The command reference](commands.md) | Every command's full chapter — the book behind the README's table |
| [Usage logs](usage-logs.md) | What Trazum can read, and what each optional field unlocks |
| [Accounts](accounts.md) | Signing in to the web app: the prompt library, share links, and what the database holds |
| [The gateway](gateway.md) | Standing in the path of the call, and refusing |
| [CI](ci.md) | Gating a build on tokens, dollars and quality |
| [Running it](running.md) | Making it happen on a schedule, and why that schedule is yours |
| [Deploying on N0](deploy-n0.md) | The web app as a hosted app, and how an update travels — pin the SHA, preview before promote |
| [The plan document](plan-format.md) | The one output meant to be kept, committed and diffed |
| [JSON output](json-output.md) | Every machine-readable document, field by field |
| [The format](format.md) | What another tool must do to emit or read this format |

## I am extending it

- **[Authoring rules](authoring-rules.md)** — how a deterministic rule is written,
  and the bar it has to clear.
- **[Maintaining a language](language-maintainer.md)** — what a dictionary
  maintainer decides, which five of the seven dictionaries nobody here reads, and
  the worklist `scripts/dictionary-worklist.mjs` prints for each.
- **[The format](format.md)** and **[JSON output](json-output.md)** — the
  contracts, each with a two-direction parity test.
- **[The prompt writer](prompt-writer.md)** — the questions `trazum write` asks,
  why each one is asked only when its answer can change the output, and what a
  declined answer costs you.
- **[The CLA](cla/CLA.md)** — what a contributor signs, what it grants and
  refuses to take, and how the gate in the pull request works.
- **[Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** — how to propose a change here.

## I am maintaining it

- **[Releasing](releasing.md)** — the recipe, and what the workflow does.
- **[Versioning](../VERSIONING.md)** — what the three numbers mean here, which is
  not quite what semver says.
- **[Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)** — every decision, every reversal, every reason.
- **[Releases](../RELEASES.md)** — the same facts written for a person with forty
  seconds.
- **[Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md)** — the history as a story, oldest first, and what is
  planned next.

## I want to report a problem

- **[Security](../SECURITY.md)** — how to report a vulnerability privately.
- **[Support](../SUPPORT.md)** — what is answered, by whom, and how fast.
- **[Code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** — what is expected of everyone here.

## The arcs, as they were planned

Nineteen plans have been written down **before** the code. Eighteen delivered in
full; one landed six of its nine arcs. The delivered plans are kept because
the reasoning is the useful part, not because anything in them is still
forthcoming: every chapter in them shipped. The 1.52–1.60 plan keeps its three
open arcs visible for the same reason — what a plan could not build, and why,
is the half a reader cannot reconstruct.

| Arc | Thesis | Landed |
|---|---|---|
| [1.30–1.35](plan-1.30-1.35.md) | The report is a document, not a print-out | 1.35.0 |
| [1.36–1.40](plan-1.36-1.40.md) | The estimating half and the measuring half had never met | 1.40.0 |
| [1.41–1.50](plan-1.41-1.50.md) | The loop is complete and inert; nothing runs on its own | 1.50.0 |
| [1.51](plan-1.51.md) | Every figure is a denominator with no numerator | 1.51.0 |
| [1.52–1.60](plan-1.52-1.60.md) | Nine arcs: finish what shipped incomplete, then widen | **six of nine** — 1.52.0, 1.53.0, 1.55.0, 1.56.0, 1.59.0 and 1.60.0 landed; 1.54.0 and 1.57.0 blocked on provider keys; 1.58.0 is a distribution commitment |
| [1.61](plan-1.61.md) | Trazum has only ever read prompts somebody else wrote | 1.61.0 — all six chapters; the model-assisted polish stays named and unbuilt |
| [1.62–1.63](plan-1.62-1.63.md) | Held to its own standard, then measured: fuzz as a fixture, perf as a gate | 1.62.0 and 1.63.0 — both arcs, all nine chapters; the ratio gate is live in CI |
| [1.64](plan-1.64.md) | The report somebody forwards: an HTML door, with the caveats travelling | 1.64.0 — all four chapters; the parity guard holds both pages |
| [1.65–1.67](plan-1.65-1.67.md) | The paths, as far as code goes: an adoptable format, one policy at three doors, a measured position | 1.65.0, 1.66.0 and 1.67.0 — all three arcs, every chapter |
| [1.68](plan-1.68.md) | The browser catches up: the position in the tab, from the same functions, with nothing uploaded | 1.68.0 — all four chapters |
| [1.69](plan-1.69.md) | The agent's own bill: Claude Code transcripts as a usage log, with nothing read but the numbers | 1.69.0 — all four chapters |
| [1.70](plan-1.70.md) | One drag: the transcripts folder onto the web app, converted in the tab, nothing uploaded | 1.70.0 — all four chapters, and the landing in five languages |
| [1.71](plan-1.71.md) | The universal cost lens: read OpenTelemetry GenAI (and, in time, every observability export) as a usage log | 1.71.0 — all four chapters, `from-otel` the fortieth command and the web tab's third arm |
| [1.72](plan-1.72.md) | The playground: the CLI's pure subset, runnable in the page on sample files | 1.72.0 — all four chapters, ten commands in the tab and the honest CLI-only note |
| [1.73](plan-1.73.md) | The guided tour: five doors walked once, offered never imposed | 1.73.0 — all four chapters, no library and no auto-play |
| [1.74](plan-1.74.md) | Any model's money: bring your own price card, and the switch priced honestly | 1.74.0 — all four chapters, commands forty-one and forty-two and the web card |
| [1.75](plan-1.75.md) | The readable terminal: hierarchy the eye can use, with a guard that colour adds nothing | 1.75.0 — all four chapters, fifty-four ruled headings and the parity guard |
| [1.76](plan-1.76.md) | The tour that does the work: every step performs its page, and the terminal types | 1.76.0 — all four chapters, three commands typed and a guard that runs them |
| [1.77](plan-1.77.md) | The agent's bill, told honestly: the four things a real profile should not have had to say | 1.77.0 — all five chapters, and a dated id prices as the model it is |
| [1.79](plan-1.79.md) | The dash the sweep left behind: an instruction obeyed by hand on one surface, finished on the other and turned into a rule | 1.79.0 — both chapters, 338 em-dashes out of the Spanish catalogues and a guard that holds them out |
| [1.83–2.0](plan-1.83-2.0.md) | The finish line, named: when this tool is done, and the last stretch walked on purpose rather than grown into | Written, nothing delivered yet. The one row in this table whose third column is a forecast, and it says so |
| [2.4](plan-2.4.md) | One door, and where the spend is: the plan that starts from a download count rather than a feature | In progress. `from-openai`, `from-openrouter` and `bill` delivered; Cursor and Hugging Face named as blocked until their schemas can be read |

What each of them **refused** to ship — which is the more useful half, since a
plan and its implementation shared a hand — is in
[our own medicine](our-own-medicine.md).

**The 1.52–1.60 plan is the one to read differently.** Its first three arcs
answer things that are wrong or missing today and point at the line of code for
each; the remaining six are an ordering of intentions. The plan says which kind
each arc is, because presenting all nine with equal confidence would merge a
measurement with a projection on the roadmap of a tool whose first doctrine rule
forbids that.
